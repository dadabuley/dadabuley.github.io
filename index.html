      yesterday I dream about a warship, <br />
	  but all the crew were dead and stand still in their old postion.<br />
	  we found several beautiful rooms like 5 star hotel<br />
	  and we select the room we want and live on the warship.<br />
	  and let this warship float on the sea by itself.

      let me try again from the begining to see if ti works or not.<br />
	  it works and I can keep this kind of update for sure.<br />
	  the next step is how to use code to make it more easier.<br / >
	  maybe python?<br />
	  it will cost me a lot of time and I need to figure out <br />
	  if it is worthy or not.

      OK, now we can start talking the real business, whey I am typing the table is shaking, make me very dizzle.<br/>
      One day goes very fast, I don't know whether it is the time goes faster, or my reaction became slower.<br/>
      everybody will keep their idea inside their mind, even in the very open internet, they will try to hide somehting<br/>
      there are many things chaos in my mind.<br/>
      I need figure them out one by one before tomorrow.

    <p>I am trying to use a more fancy blogsite, but I don't wanna make things complicated, <br />
          so I still keep using edit the index.html for updating</p>
      <p>which means I will not able to catalogize the post, <br />
        and I couldn't see your comments either, but never mind, this is just the field<br />
        I put some words here. hope one day I can find a better way out. and you can email me through the buttom of page</p>
